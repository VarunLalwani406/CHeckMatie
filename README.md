# ♟️ Chess Engine Project: Classic AI + RL

Build my own competitive chess engine! This project combines **classical AI** (like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning) with **Reinforcement Learning** to create a fully functional engine you can play against.


## 🚀 What I Learnt
- Board representation & move generation
- Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, heuristics
- Zobrist hashing & transposition tables
- Efficiently Updatable Neural Network (NNUE)
- RL (Q-learning, self-play, policy tuning)
